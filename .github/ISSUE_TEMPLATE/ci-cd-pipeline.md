## Description

**As a** DevOps engineer  
**I want to** integrate Jenkins CI/CD pipeline with ArgoCD and Amazon EKS  
**So that** automated deployment and management of Kubernetes workloads can be achieved effectively.

## Requirements

1. **Jenkins Server Setup**:
   - **Operating System**: RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux) image on AWS.
   - **Hardware Requirements**:
     - CPUs: 4
     - RAM: 8GB
     - Storage: 50GB.
   - **Jenkins Version**: Latest LTS version.
   - **Plugins Required**: Git, Pipeline, Kubernetes Continuous Deploy, Blue Ocean.

2. **Pipeline Integration**:
   - Jenkins CI pipeline to handle Build and Test stages.
   - Integration with ArgoCD for the Deploy stage to manage Kubernetes workloads on EKS.

3. **ArgoCD Setup**:
   - Deployed on Amazon EKS.
   - Configured to sync with a GitOps repository for automated Kubernetes resource deployment.
   - Secure communication between Jenkins and ArgoCD for pipeline integration.

4. **Amazon EKS Details**:
   - **Region**: Specify AWS region (e.g., `ap-south-1`).
   - **Cluster Nodes**:
     - Node Count: 3
     - Instance Type: [e.g., t3.medium]
     - Autoscaling Enabled: Yes/No.

5. **Future Scaling**:
   - Capabilities for scaling Jenkins and EKS infrastructure to handle increased workload.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Deploy the RHEL image on AWS.
2. Install Jenkins with required plugins and configure CI pipeline stages (Build, Test).
3. Set up ArgoCD on EKS and configure a GitOps repository.
4. Configure Jenkins to trigger ArgoCD for the Deploy stage.
5. Test the full pipeline with sample Kubernetes workloads.

## Expected Outcome

A fully integrated CI/CD solution where Jenkins handles Build and Test stages, and ArgoCD manages automated deployments to EKS using a GitOps workflow.

## Actual Outcome

_Provide details if there are any issues or deviations after setup._

## Additional Context

- Known blockers: Potential issues with Jenkins-ArgoCD integration or EKS scaling.
- Dependencies: Ensure IAM roles and policies are properly configured for secure communication between Jenkins, ArgoCD, and EKS.
